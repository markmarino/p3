## Description
Developer's Best Friend is a Laravel-based web app comprised of two useful utilities for developers: a random user generator, and a lorem ipsum dummy text generator. Most of the heavy lifting is done via [Francois Zaninotto's Faker PHP package](https://github.com/fzaninotto/Faker). The front-end look and feel is using the Bootstrap framework.

## Demo
Coming Soon!

## Details for teaching team
I was greatly influenced on the execution for this project by [Susan Buck's Shipper app demo video](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GaJBiPdqaUYhtd2BKze4MJgL1Yn2nIG-HraHZRsmShA/edit), which helped me conceptualize the big-picture for pulling the app together as well as ironing out a lot of the nuts and bolts of implementing this app using Laravel and the MVC model. Also a big thanks to Rebekah Heacock Jones for her help with getting my validation code working... the devil is in the details.
